# Process Modeling

Models are mapping of a real-world phenomenon, developed for the purpose of reducing overall complexity.

Models abstract from certain details and document only relevant aspects of the real world.

**Models are being developed**

1. in a specific modelling subject
2. for a specific target audience
3. with a specific modelling purpose in mind

### Purposes of Process Modeling

- Communication
- Documentation
- Analysis

A loan application is approved if it passes two checks: i) the applicant’s loan risk assessment, done automatically by a system, and ii) the appraisal of the property for which the loan has been asked, carried out by a property appraiser. The risk assessment requires a credit history check on the applicant, which is performed by a financial officer. Once both the loan risk assessment and the property appraisal have been performed, a loan officer can assess the applicant’s eligibility. If the applicant is not eligible, the application is rejected, otherwise the acceptance pack is prepared and sent to the applicant.

A company has two warehouses that store different products: Amsterdam and Hamburg.
When an order is received, it is distributed across these warehouses:
• If some of the relevant products are maintained in Amsterdam, a sub-order is sent there;
• likewise, if some relevant products are maintained in Hamburg, a sub-order is sent there.
Afterwards, the order is registered, and the process completes.

A loan application may be coupled with a home insurance which is offered at discounted prices. The
applicants may express their interest in a home insurance plan at the time of submitting their loan
application to the loan provider. Based on this information, if the loan application is approved, the loan
provider may either only send an acceptance pack to the applicant, or also send a home insurance quote.
The process then continues with the verification of the repayment agreement.

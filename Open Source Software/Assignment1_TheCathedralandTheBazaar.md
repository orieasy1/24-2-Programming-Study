The author is talking about how to develop an open source. Based on the author's experience, I am focusing on what has come to me and what I have learned. I am comparing 'Cathedral' and 'Bazaar' to the development method.

The concept of the "Cathedral" in The Cathedral and the Bazaar represents a traditional, centralized, and highly controlled model of software development. In this model, software is carefully crafted by a small group of developers, working in isolation, releasing beta versions only when the product is fully polished. 
The author believed that operating systems such as traditional Unix or large software should be developed thoroughly and deliberately by a small number of professionals in an isolated environment. They believed that this method required time-consuming and thorough design, as if building a cathedral.

The "Bazaar" contrasts the "Cathedral" and represents a decentralized, collaborative, and open model of software development. It’s characterized by the Linux development model, where the software evolves through frequent releases and feedback from a wide community of developers.
Linus Torvalds launched frequently in the early days, distributed everything, and allowed anyone to participate. A complex system has miraculously evolved in this "market" involving people with diverse objectives and approaches.

Main Features of Cathedral:
Centralized control by a limited number of developers.
Infrequent and carefully planned releases.
A focus on perfection before releasing to the public.

Main Features of Bazaar:
Decentralized, open, and collaborative development.
Frequent, early releases, incorporating feedback from users and developers.
A flexible and adaptive development model.

19 Good Practices (Lessons) from the Book
Here are the 19 lessons (practices) outlined in The Cathedral and the Bazaar:
1.	Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2.	Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3.	Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow (from Fred Brooks).
4.	If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5.	When you lose interest in a program, your last duty is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6.	Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
7.	Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
8.	Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to someone.
9.	Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
10.	If you treat your beta-testers as if they’re your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
11.	The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
12.	Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
13.	Perfection in design is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away (from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry).
14.	Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
15.	When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to.
16.	When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
17.	A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
18.	To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
19.	Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

The following three lessons were the most memorable. The reasons are as follows.
Release early, release often, and listen to your customers (Lesson 7): This lesson emphasizes the importance of feedback and iteration, a key strength of open-source development.
Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow (Lesson 8): Known as "Linus's Law," it underlines the power of community collaboration in solving problems efficiently.
Perfection is achieved when there is nothing more to take away (Lesson 13): This reflects the elegance and simplicity in design, aiming for clarity and minimalism in development

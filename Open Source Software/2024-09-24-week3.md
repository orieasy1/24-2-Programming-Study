# Version Control with Git/GitHub I

Git is Vesion Control system

**Version Control System**: Tool that helps track and manage changes to software code over time

**Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

It allow you to 

- revert selected files back to a previous state
- revert the entire project back to a previous state
- compare changes over time
- See who last modified something that might be casuing problem
- see who introduced an issue and when
    
    â€¦
    

Keep track of changes to code

Synchronizes code bewteen different people

Test changes to code without losing the original

Revert ack to old versions of code

### The three states: modified, staged, committed

Git has three main states that your files can reside in

- **Modified** means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your DB yet.
- **Staged** means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
- **Committed** means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

### Three sections of a Git project

- The **working tree** is a single checkout of one version of the project.
- The **staging area** is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.
- The **Git directory** is where Git stores the metat data and object database for your project.
